# [Software Engineering Portfolio Website](https://doroteo-arango.github.io)
Details my most-acclaimed projects. I update this website every once-in-a-while with new information. However the most up-to-date version of my projects are listed on my GitHub.

I used GitHub Pages to host this website essentially for free via static HTML pages. However, the initial website was created in Django, and converted for public usage.
